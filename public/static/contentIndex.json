The word Trika means “the threefold science of man and his world.” In the idea of trika, there are three Śakti-s (energies): parā (supreme), aparā (lowest), and parāpara (combination of the lowest and the highest). These three primary energies represent the threefold activities of the world. In the thought of the Trika, therefore, it is admitted that this whole universe and every action in it, whether spiritual, physical, or worldly, is existing in these three energies.\n\n“THE TRIKA PHILOSOPHY IS MEANT FOR ANY HUMAN BEING WITHOUT THE RESTRICTION OF CASTE, CREED, OR COLOR. ITS PURPOSE IS TO ENABLE YOU TO RISE FROM INDIVIDUALITY TO UNIVERSALITY.”\n- Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū\n\nThe Trika System is comprised of four sub-schools; the pratyabhijñā school, the kula school, the krama school, and the spanda school. These four systems, which form the one thought of the Trika system, all accept and are based on the same scriptures (Āgama-s). These scriptures form the ninety-two Āgama-s of Shaivism. The monistic Bhairava Śāstra-s are supreme (parā) and are sixty-four in number; the mono-dualistic Rudra Śāstra-s are medium (parāpara) and are eighteen in number; and the dualistic Śiva Śāstra-s are inferior (aparā) and are ten in number."},"Introduction/krama/krama":{"title":"krama","links":[],"tags":["krama","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Krama System.” ]■[\n⎯ The Krama system does not recognize the ways of either the Pratyabhijna or the Kula system. In the Krama system, you must rise in succession, step by step. This system teaches that step-by-step realization makes your realization firm. As the Krama system is concerned with successive realization, it is primarily concerned with space and time, because where there is succession there you find the existence of space and time. In both the Pratyabhijna and Kula systems you are beyond space and time. In the Krama system, it is in the end, not in its process, that you are beyond time and space because it also carries you to that timeless and space-less state.\n\n“The Krama system is primarily attributed to shaktopaya and to the twelve Kalis.”\n\nThe twelve Kalis are said to be the twelve movements of any one cognition. For example, if you look at any object such as a pot, the sensation travels from your thought to the place of the pot, and then returns again from the place of the pot to your thought, giving you the sensation whereby you realize this pot. You do not realize this pot at the place of the pot, you realize this pot in your mind. Your perception has moved from inside to the pot, and then returned again from the pot to your thought. And these movements are distributed in twelve ways as the twelve Kalis in the Krama system.\nThe rise of prana kundalini is also described in the Krama system, because in prana kundalini you rise from one cakra to another, from one state to another state. As this is a successive process it is found in the Krama system.\nAlthough the Krama system existed in the beginning of kali-yuga, having been introduced by the sage Durvasa, it was reintroduced at the end of the 7th century A.D. in Kashmir by the sage Erakanatha, who was also known as Shivanandanatha. Shivanandanatha had only three chief disciples which he initiated into the Krama system. Because in this system predominance is given only to shakti, all three were females. Their names were Keyuravati, Madanika, and Kalyanika. They were quite prominent and were completely informed in the Krama system. Afterwards, these ladies also initiated disciples, which were both male and female."},"Introduction/kula-akula/kula":{"title":"kula","links":[],"tags":["kula","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Kula System.” ]■[\n⎯ The Kula system teaches you how you can live in caitanya (universal Consciousness), the real nature of yourself, in the act of ascending and descending. While you rise from the lowest to the highest you realize your nature, and while you descend from the highest to the lowest you also realize your nature.\n“In the Kula system, there is no break in the realization of your own nature either in the highest or in the lowest cycle. This system, therefore, teaches you how you can live in totality.”\nIn fact, the word kula means “totality.”\nIn the practice of the Kula system, you have to realize the totality of the universe in one particle. Take one particle of anything that exists in this world; in that one particle is to be realized the totality of the whole universe. The totality of energy is found in one particle. Everything is full of one thing and one thing is full of all things.\nThe difference between the Pratyabhijna system and the Kula system is, that the Pratyabhijna system teaches you how to realize your own nature in one place and exist there, reside there. While the Kula system teaches you how you can rise from the lowest degree to the highest degree, and all the while, experience the nature of your Self on the same level and state. Shiva, which is realized in prithvi tattva (earth element), is the same level, the same reality of Shiva which is realized in Shiva tattva. Here, there is complete realization in every act of the world.\nThe Kula system was introduced in Kashmir in the beginning of the 5th century A.D. by Shri Macchandanatha. Later, in the 9th century, because its teachings had become distorted, it was reintroduced by Sumatinatha. In the line of masters that followed from Sumatinatha, Somanatha was his disciple. Shambhunatha was the disciple of Somanatha, and the great Abhinavagupta was the disciple of Shambhunatha."},"Introduction/pratyabhijna/pratyabhijñā":{"title":"pratyabhijna","links":[],"tags":["pratyabhijna","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Pratyabhijna System.” ]■[\n⎯ The word pratyabhijna means “to spontaneously once again recognize and realize your Self.” Here you have only to realize, you do not have to practice. There are no upayas (means) in the Pratyabhijna system. You must simply recognize who you are. Wherever you are, whether you are at the level of Supreme Being, at the level of yoga, or at that level which is disgusting, you can recognize your own Nature then and there without moving anywhere or doing anything.\nFor example, take the case of a bride and groom. The woman has not seen her husband-to-be and craves to see him. Concerning him she has only heard praise and glory but she has not actually met him. Suppose this girl and her future husband happen by chance to go separately on the same pilgrimage. When they arrive at the place of pilgrimage, they meet. The girl, however, does not feel any importance in this man because she does not know him to be her future husband. Yet her future husband and this man are the same person. Later, when a friend introduces her to him, telling her that this is the man who is to be her husband, then she is filled with happiness, pleasure, and ecstasy. She realizes that this is the same man she had seen before.\nIn the same way, reality dawns in the Pratyabhijna system. In whichever level you are situated, do not mind.\n“The moment recognition dawns, not only do you instantaneously become divine, but you also realize that you were already divine.”\nAt that moment, you realize that you were already the Lord but did not know it because you had misunderstood yourself.\nIn the Pratyabhijna philosophy it is your master who tells you, that ‘you are the same person for whom you are longing’, and he teaches you to reach the goal there and then without adopting any means. This teaching, therefore, is situated chiefly in anupaya, which is that means where there are no means at all. It is the recognition that there was nothing to be done and nowhere to go. Here, there is no practice, no concentration and no meditation. By the grace of your master you realize it and you are there.\nThe Pratyabhijna system was flourishing in the beginning of kali-yuga. As time passed, however, it became veiled due to misunderstanding. It wasn’t until the end of the eighth century A.D. that the great master Somananda reintroduced the Pratyabhijna system in Kashmir. Somananda’s disciple was Utpaladeva, and his disciple was Lakshmanagupta, and his disciple was the very great Abhinavagupta."},"Introduction/spanda/spanda":{"title":"spanda","links":[],"tags":["spanda","introduction","articles"],"content":"]■[ “Spanda System.” ]■[\n⎯ The fourth system, which comprises the Trika philosophy, is called the Spanda system. The word spanda means “movement.”\n“The Spanda school recognizes that nothing can exist without movement. Where there is movement there is life, and where there is no movement that is lifelessness.”\nThey realize that there is movement in wakefulness, dreaming, deep sleep, and turya. Though some thinkers argue that there is no movement in deep sleep the philosophers of the Spanda system realize that nothing can exist without movement.\nThe teachings of the Spanda system, which is an important practical system, are found embodied in the “Vijnana Bhairava Tantra,” the “Svacchanda Tantra,” and in the 6th chapter of the “Tantraloka.”\nThe Spanda System was introduced in Kashmir by the great sage Vasuguptanatha at the beginning of the 8th century A.D. Vasuguptanatha is the author of both the “Shiva Sutras” and the “Spanda Karikas.” The disciple of Vasuguptanatha was Kallata.\nSome teachers think that the “Spanda Karikas” were not composed by Vasuguptanatha but rather by his disciple Kallata. This theory, however, is absolutely incorrect."},"Introduction/trikashasan/trikashasan-introduction-en":{"title":"an introduction to trikaśāsan [tāntrik philosophy]","links":[],"tags":["introduction","trikashasan","articles","lineage","pratyabhijna","kula","krama","spanda","history","origin","kashmirshaivism"],"content":"The stream of Bhāratiya knowledge and practice has been flowing in two forms, Vedik and Āgama. If the root of the Vedik flow is the exhalation of Vāmdeva, one of the mouths of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, then the root of the Āgamaic or Tāntrik flow is the speech of the five mouths of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava, and the Bhairavāgamadhārā (Bhairavāgamik flow)—eternal; indifference; is free and secret; And this stream is always implemented by the spontaneous grace of Lord Swachchandanātha Bhairava.\n\nAfter this, the Rudragāma which is dual-cum-nondual and the Shivagāma which is dual etc. are streams. In later times, the followers of both these and the followers of Vedik etc. streams influenced each other and the doctrines, customs and practices of one became partly mixed with the doctrines, customs and practices of the other. As a result, a mixed moral tradition prevailed. Rudrasukta in Vedic literature; Śwetāśvatara; Paśupāt; Brahma; Tripuratāpini; Tripurā; Katharudra; The use of Vedik mantras in the Upanishads like Bhāvanā and Tāntrik worship and practice is a gift of these systems. Even so, Tāntrik literature has some basic principles of its own that make it completely distinct and perfect from Vedik literature.\n\nAll philosophies accept the Supreme Being in the root of the universe in some form or the other. “Trikahṛdaya” and “Trikaśāsan” are the basic foundation of all those philosophies &amp; religions. The Supreme Being that has been accepted here is undivided. In the deepest state of the Absolute, it is impossible to imagine ‘Ćidānaṇda.’ It is the “Niranśa Anūttar Parā” state. In this deepest state of Sanmātra, one aspect of the Supreme Being springs out in the form of self-illumination, which is called ‘Ćit’ or ‘Ćiti’ in the language of Trika. This ‘Ćidbhāv of his is the initial light of his outward orientation. It is called “Anūttara” in the language of Bhairavāgamas.\n\nThe “अ” (a) of the Sanskrit language or of the Mātṛkā Ćakra of the Śiva Sutra symbolizes this “Anūttara” state. From that Supreme Being this consciousness continues to emerge eternally. Just as the mind is externalized because of the vibration in bliss, so the mind also vibrates. As a result of this vibration, on the one hand, the mind holds on to bliss; So on the other hand, it produces a second mind. This second mind sees its form when it is reflected in the first mind. This recognition or favorable sensation of his own being is called “bliss”.\n\nIn the behavioral world, this is like a mirror image situation; But this mirrored reflection is partially indistinguishable from Śiva. This deduction proves that the unbroken entity is the form of the mind. This entity is independent, that is, other-neutral. Satyaṃ Śivaṃ Sundaraṃ expresses this same essence. It is the form of mind in terms of expression of pure Śiva and bliss in terms of taste. According to the Trinity rule, Paraṃ Śiva and Paraṃ Śakti are indistinguishable. Both are Ćidrupa and are integral in the same way as fire and its combustible power.\n\nThis is the state of ultimate equality “Yāmala” or “inclusion”. There is no gender distinction. Although this is a state of indifference, the discriminating Aṇu (individual) sees the difference in it. From the worldly point of view, “Parābhairava” is always fivefold.\n\n“TRIKAŚĀSAN” ALSO KNOWN AS “TRIKĀĆĀRA”:\nVedāćāra, Vaiśnavaćāra, Śaivāćāra, Dakṣīnāćāra, Vāmāćāra, Siddhāntāćāra, Kaulāćāra, all these sequences of conduct are meant to elevate the seeker to the highest “TRIKĀĆĀRA”.\n\nThere are two sides to “TRIKAŚĀSAN SVĀTAṆTRYAVĀDA”:— 1] The philosophical side and; 2] The Sādhanā aspect.\nAnalysis of the philosophical aspect, the Great “Trikahṛdaya–Siddha” gurus like Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Somānaṇda, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Bhaṭṭakallatji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Vāsuguptaji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Utpaldevaji, Lord Śri Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaji have described Pratyabhijñā and Vibration; order; in philosophical texts like Śivadṛṣṭī, Īśvarpratyabhijñā, Spandakārīkā, Tantrāloka etc. related to the clan. The intriguing spiritual mysteries of the Sādhanā aspect have been explained in many Bhairavāgama texts like Tantrāloka and Śriparātriṃśikā, Śri Svachchanda Tantra of Gurudev Bhagavān Śri Mahāmaheśwara Abhinavaguptaḥ. On the philosophical side, the basic principles established by various logical arguments have been universally accepted and certain. Those principles have not been refined or modified at any level to date. There have been many forms of the adverse cultivation side, since ancient times. In order to bring into experience the spiritual facts explained in the philosophical aspect, different Trika Siddha Gurus adopted different types of sādhanā paths and also initiated their disciples accordingly. These different types of sādhanā paths were given the name of āćāras. “TRIKĀĆĀRA” is also one of these principal practices, and the Śaiva “TRIKAŚĀSAN” tradition of Kashmir is called “Abhed–Trikāćāra” as a whole.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です"},"Introduction/trikashasan/trikashasan-introduction":{"title":"“त्रिकशासन” (तन्त्र दर्शन): एक परिचय.","links":[],"tags":["introduction","trikashasan","articles","lineage","pratyabhijna","krama","kula","spanda","history","origin","kashmirshaivism"],"content":"भारतीय ज्ञान एवं साधना की धारा वैदिक और आगम दो रूपों में प्रवाहित होती आ रही है। वैदिक प्रवाह का मूल यदि भगवान् स्वच्छंदनाथ भैरवजी के एक मुख वामदेव का उच्छ्वास है, तो आगमिक या तान्त्रिक प्रवाह का मूल भगवान् स्वच्छंदनाथ भैरवजी के पंच मुखों कि वाणी है, और इनसे उत्पन्न—भैरवागमधारा—अनादि;

तो दूसरी ओर उससे द्वितीय चित् उत्पन्न होता है। यह द्वितीय चित् जब प्रथम चित् में प्रतिबिम्बित होता है तब अपने स्वरूप को देखता है। उसकी अपनी सत्ता की यही पहचान या अनुकूल संवेदन “आनन्द” कही जाती है।\n\nव्यवहार जगत् में यह दर्पणगत प्रतिबिम्ब की स्थिति जैसी है; परंतु यह दर्पणगत प्रतिबिम्ब शिव से अंशतः अभेद होता है। इस निर्वचन से यह सिद्ध होता है कि अखण्ड सत्ता चित्स्वरूप है। यह सत्ता स्वतन्त्र अर्थात अन्यनिरपेक्ष है। सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम से इसी सत्ता का अभिव्यञ्जन होता है। यह विशुद्ध शिव की अभिव्यक्ति की दृष्टि से चित् तथा रसास्वाद की दृष्टि से आनन्दस्वरूप है। यही त्रिक शासन के अनुसार परमशिव और परमशक्ति हैं और दोनो अभेद है। दोनों चिद्रूप है और उसी प्रकार अभिन्न हैं जैसे अग्नि और उसकी दाहकता शक्ति।\n\nयही परम साम्य “यामल” अथवा “समावेश” की स्थिति है। इसमें लिङ्गभेद नहीं है। यद्यपि यह अभेद की स्थिति है तथापि भेददृष्टि रखनेवाले अनु को इसमें भेद दिखाई पड़ता है। जागतिक दृष्टिकोण से “परभैरव” सर्वदा पञ्चकृत्यकारी है।\n\n“त्रिकशासन” उपनाम त्रिकाचार:\nवेदाचार, वैश्नवाचार, शैवाचार, दक्षिणाचार, वामाचार, सिद्धान्ताचार, कौलाचार यह सारे आचारोंका क्रम साधक को सर्वोच्च “त्रिकाचार” मे बढाने के लिये है।\n\n“त्रिकशासन स्वतंत्र्यवाद” के दो पक्ष हैं:— १] दार्शनिक पक्ष और;

As Svacchandanātha, He appeared with five heads and eighteen arms. His five heads came into manifestation through his five great energies: cit śakti, all consciousness; ānanda śakti, all bliss; icchā śakti, all will; jñāna śakti, all knowledge; and kriyā śakti, all action. And these five energies, which appeared in His five mouths and which are known as īśāna, tatpuruṣa, aghora, vāmadeva and sadyojāta, because of the grace (anugrahaḥ) of Lord Śiva, experienced the sensation of illuminating the Universe.\n![Pasted image 20240918125958.png](../metadata/images/Pasted image 20240918125958.png)\nSvacchandanātha &amp; The Manifestation of 92 Āgama-s:\nLord Śiva wanted to enlighten the universe by manifesting the existence of the Tantras. In order to accomplish this, He manifested these Tantras through his five mouths. Initially, each of these mouths—īśāna, tatpuruṣa, aghora, vāmadeva and sadyojāta—created one Tantra. Then two mouths joined together and created one Tantra from each combination of two mouths. And then three mouths joined together and created one Tantra from each combination of three mouths. And then four mouths joined together, and then five mouths, and these combinations of mouths produced all of the Tantras of our Śaivism.\nThese Tantras are manifested in three ways. Initially, ten Tantras came into existence which were dualistic (bheda) and are called Śiva Tantras. These Tantras, which are not connected with Kashmir Śaivism, are filled with dualism. Then eighteen Tantras came into existence, which were filled with that thought which is monism cum dualism (bhedābheda). These Tantras are called Rudra Tantras. And finally, these five mouths came into existence in such a way that each and every mouth was simultaneously filled with the other four mouths. Here, four of the five energies were inserted into the fifth energy in such a way that it became full with all five energies. No one energy was in predominance, all were equal. And this happened to each and every energy. Simultaneously, from these mouths came the Bhairava Tantras, which are filled with only monistic thought (abheda). These Bhairava Tantras, which are the Tantras connected with Kashmir Śaivism, are sixty-four in number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nĀgama-sState64 Bairavāgama-sParā, Abheda, Brutally Non-dualistic tantras18 Rudrāgama-sParāpara, Bhedābheda, Dualistic cum Non-dualistic tantras10 Śivāgama-sApara, Bheda, Dualistic tantras\n\nParābhairava &amp; Bhairavi (The Beginning of Satyayug)\nIn the Bhairava Tantras, Lord Śiva is shown to be in predominance everywhere. He is there in fullness in Śiva and in all of His energies. He is equally present in everything and everywhere. You cannot say that something is closer to Him and something else is farther away. In everything He is there, fully and completely.\nVākćtuṣtaya-s (States of Speech) &amp; The Transmission of Āgama-s:\nInitially, this monistic Tantra, in the form of one Supreme Consciousness and Bliss, was not manifested in will, imagination, or words; rather, it was felt and observed by Lord Śiva Himself at the start of the illuminating energy. At this point, the manifestation of this Tantra resided in Lord Śiva’s innermost speech, known as Parāvāk (supreme speech). In this supreme speech of Lord Śiva, the creation of vācya and vācaka, master and disciple, was not yet felt as being differentiated. They resided in His own Being as undifferentiated. In the next movement of illuminating energy, the manifestation of the Tantras was held in his second speech, paśyantī. At this stage also, these Tantras were still undifferentiated and were one with His Supreme Will. In the next movement of illuminating energy, these Tantras were held in His third speech, madhyamā vāk. Here, they became differentiated and were manifested internally only in thought not in words. And in the final movement of illuminating energy, these Tantras were held in His fourth speech, vaikharī vāk, where they came out through His five mouths in differentiation as words, sentences, and verses.\nThe Revival of Trika in Kalyug:\nIn the three yugas (ages), satyuga, tretāyuga, and dvāparayuga, masters and disciples were initiated verbally, not in writing, requiring words and sentences. The power of memory in them was so great that they remembered everything instantaneously. There was no need for them to write anything down or to refer to books and papers. The masters and disciples were very great during these three yugas.\nWhen kaliyuga occurred, these masters and disciples were so disappointed that they hid themselves in unknown places in order to avoid the touch of worldly people living at that time. Because of this, the theory of the Bhairava Tantras and Kashmir Śaivism was lost. Lord Śiva, however, always wishes to illuminate the universe and so He reappeared in this world at Mount Kailāśa, not in the form of Svacchandanātha with five mouths, but in the form of Śrīkaṇṭhanātha. And in the form of Śrīkaṇṭhanātha, He again taught the theory of the Bhairava Tantras to the sage Durvāsā Ṛṣi, who was ūrdhvaretaḥ, which means “one whose power of sex is preserved,” and who was, therefore, a brahmacārī (celibate). When Śrīkaṇṭhanātha initiated him at Mount Kailāśa, Śrīkaṇṭhanātha told him that he was to expand the thought of Bhairava Tantras in all of the universe without restriction to caste, color, or creed. After Śrīkaṇṭhanātha taught Durvāsā Ṛṣi in this manner, he disappeared into the ether.\n\nŚiva Pārvatī Pariwār (Art: Unknown)\nThe First Parameṣthī Guru of Trikaśāsana - Durvāsā Ṛṣi:\nDurvāsā Ṛṣi, after meditating completely to acquire a real and fit disciple for initiation, became disappointed. He could not find anyone in this world fit to be initiated. His initiation was a practical initiation because, while initiating someone in the thought of Bhairava Tantras, he simultaneously initiated him in the practical side of this thought. And this practical initiation manifested itself immediately without the disciples having to do any practice or yoga. This disciple would become instantaneously enlightened. As he could not find a disciple fit for this initiation, he created out of his mental power one mind-born son. This mind-born son was called Tryambakanātha. Durvāsā Ṛṣi completely initiated Tryambakanātha in the way of the monistic Bhairava Tantras. Afterwards, he created two more mind-born sons, Āmardakanātha and Śrīnātha. He initiated his son Āmardakanātha in the dualistic Śiva Tantras and he initiated his other son Śrinātha in the monodualistic Rudra Tantras. All of this was done by Durvāsā Ṛṣi for the upliftment of mankind.\n\nA painting depicting Durvasa\nFor the upliftment of women, Durvāsā Ṛṣi created one mind-born daughter and she was called Ardhatryambakā. As Kashmir Śaivism does not recognize women to be in a state of degradation, Durvāsā Ṛṣi initiated her completely in the monistic thought of Bhairava Tantras. As this view, that women are not in a state of degradation, is not held by the other two schools of Śaivism, the dualistic and monodualistic schools, Durvāsā Ṛṣi created only one-mind born daughter. His daughter Ardhatryambakā’s teaching is known as the Ardhatryambaka school of the Bhairava Tantras. But as the continuity of the Ardhatryambaka school manifested itself from one woman to another secretly, there is no history of this school in this kaliyuga.\nThe Unbroken Lineage of Trika:\nDurvāsā Ṛṣi’s son Tryambakanātha, the founder of the monistic school of Śaivism, was also a celibate (brahmacārī). According to the way of the sage Durvāsā Ṛṣi, he also created one mind-born son and named him Tryambakāditya, which means “the expansion of Tryambakanātha.” After initiating him completely in Bhairava Tantras, Tryambakanātha entered a cave, which is known as Tryambaka Guhā (cave), and disappeared. Tryambakanātha’s son Tryambakāditya also created one mind-born son and, after initiating him, Tryambakāditya disappeared into the ether.\n\nPancamukhī Śiva Pārvatī &amp; Nandi alongside Ṛṣabha bull (Art: Unknown)\nIn this manner fifteen siddhas were created by mind. When, however, the fifteenth siddha attempted to create a mind-born son, he was not successful. It is said that this fifteenth siddha was not fully introverted, but at the same time he was also given to worldly pleasures. Because of this subtle impurity (āṇava mala), he was not successful in creating a mind-born son. After sitting in long meditation, he found in this world a girl with all good qualities and he went to her father and made arrangements to marry her. After marriage, they created one son who was called Saṁgamāditya and who, by his will, came to the valley of Kashmir and found Kailāśa mountain. Saṁgamāditya, like his father, married and produced one son named Varṣāditya, whom he initiated completely in the thought of the monistic Bhairava Tantras. Varṣāditya also married and produced one son, named Aruṇāditya, whom he initiated fully. Aruṇāditya married and created one son named Ānanda, whom he initiated and who was also completely informed practically in Śaivism.\nThis sage Ānanda was the father of Somānandanātha, the originator of the Pratyabhijñā School of Śaivism and the author of the “Śiva Dṛṣṭi.” Up to the time of Somānandanātha, the initiation into the monistic thought of Bhairava Tantras took place from father to son. From Somānandanātha on, this initiation took place from master to disciple. Somānandanātha was the master of Utpaladeva. Utpaladeva was the master of Lakṣmaṇagupta. And Lakṣmaṇagupta was a master of our great Abhinavagupta, who was in the line of Atrigupta.\nNow I will explain to you how this Atrigupta, a great scholar of Kashmir Śaivism, came from India to live in the Kashmir Valley.\nDuring his reign, the king Lalitāditya traveled to India from Kashmir, where in Antarvedi, a tract of land in Madhya Pradesh which lies between the Yamuna and Ganga rivers, he discovered this great Śaiva teacher Atrigupta. Lalitāditya was deeply impressed by the scholarship and practical way of Atrigupta and requested him to accompany him to the Kashmir Valley. Atrigupta agreed and upon reaching Kashmir, was given the old palace of Pravarasena to live in because it was very near to the palace of the king Lalitāditya. After he moved to Kashmir, there was no authority on Kashmir Śaivism left in India. From this time forward, the teaching of the thought of Bhairava Tantras is called Kashmir Śaivism and this teaching has continued to remain centered only in the Kashmir Valley. These Bhairava Tantras are pervasive throughout the whole world.\nHowever, they began in the Kashmir Valley, resided there, and are still alive there today. After some centuries in the house of Atrigupta, Varāhagupta was born. He is the father of Narasiṁhagupta and Narasiṁhagupta is the father of our great Abhinavagupta. Although Abhinavagupta had many disciples, both men and women, his chief disciple was Kṣemarāja and the chief disciple of Kṣemarāja was Yogarāja. After many centuries in the Kashmir Valley, Svāmī Ram came into this physical body. His chief disciple was Svāmī Mahatābakak and my Guru Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj is the disciple of Svāmī Mahatābakak and I am disciple of Swāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj.\n\nSwāmi Lakṣamaṇa Jū Mahārāj"},"Practices/external-discipline":{"title":"external discipline","links":["Practices/internal-posture"],"tags":["discipline","practices","awareness","sadhana","yama","niyama","articles"],"content":"—Yama Niyama—\n—Swami Lakshamanjoo—\n∫Sunday, April 27, 1980∫\n\nEvery human being must strive for self-realization. When the individual self has right knowledge of the universal Self and recognizes its Divinity without the least apprehension, it is known as Union or Yoga. Patanjali has explained eight limbs of Yoga in his Yoga-Sutras. However The Kashmir Śaiva philosophy also recognizes the Yoga-Sutras and we have our own independent system for limbs of Yoga, where it is stressed that the first two parts, i.e. Yamas and Niyamas must have already been practised. In Kashmir Śaivism the eight limbs of Yoga begin from Asanas—the right posture. By practising the first two one prepares oneself for the spiritual path. This is the development of etiquette. This is the external behavior. Unless one develops the external behavior how can one delve deeper into subtleties!\n\nनित्योदिता पराशक्तिर्यद्यप्येषा तथापि च।\nबाह्यचर्याविहीनस्य दुर्लभा कौलिकी स्थितिः॥\n— Quoted by Jayarathа on Tantraloka 12.16.\nMeaning:\nThe power of supreme consciousness is always present in awareness, always pure and untainted. But for a person who lacks in external behaviour, it is impossible to get established in this unalloyed bliss.\n\nTherefore, unless the aspirant has become well prepared in the external behaviour, or developed the right etiquette, he is bound down with chains of illusion/limitedness and doubt more and more in the prison of this world.\nतथा हि शंका मालिन्यं ग्लानिः संकोच इत्यदः॥\nसंसारकारागारान्तः स्थूलस्थूणाघटायते।\n— Tantraloka 12.20-21.\nMeaning:\nIgnorance is the subtlest impurity which gives rise to doubt. This loosens the spirit of courage to advance towards purity of mind and renders lethargic. Automatically one gets bound to limitation of body etc. This causes degradation. Thus the human being gets strongly tethered like tame animal with the rope of ignorance in the prison of this world.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary that one must first execute one’s efforts towards the development of external behaviour or etiquette for becoming fit to receive grace of the Master.\nOtherwise, the one upon whom the Master becomes angry is left out:—\nगुरुर्हि कुपितो यस्य स तिरोहित उच्यते।\n—Tantraloka 23.63.\nThe favour of doing good is denied to him.\n\nIt is, therefore, stressed that the five Yamas (internal disciplines) should be followed first:—\n\n∆ Non-violence (Ahiṃsa) ∆ — Do not hurt anybody by mind, word or deed. Do not reveal the faults of others. Keep quiet. Do not look to others&#039; faults. Seeing your ideal they will by themselves be set right. By practising this virtue one&#039;s foes turn into friends in course of time.\n\n∆ Truth (Satyaṁ) ∆ — Do not harbour any idea of deceit and trouble in the mind in your dealings with others. Speak the loving and sweet truth. Do not use harsh words in doing so, lest the listener&#039;s feelings should get hurt in any way. Be friendly with all. Being truthful in this sense your word of blessing will bear immediate fruit. Your word will be effective.\n\n∆ Non-stealing (Astēyaṁ) ∆ — Do not have any idea of stealing through your mind, word or deed. Never even think, for instance, “what a nice watch he has. I would like to have this.” Mere thinking like this involves you in the crime of theft. One who never steals or becomes greedy, enjoys real happiness.\n\n∆ Celibacy (Brahmacaryaṁ) ∆ — Maintain high character in mind, word and deed. Even the householder, who leads his life according to the injunctions of the Sacred Ordinance, can live the life of Brahmacaryaṁ—celibacy. To be given to the practice of the Realization of Self is also termed celibacy. Such a person gets wonderful powers and no common man can compete him.\n\n∆ Non-hoarding (Aparigrahaḥ) ∆ — Hoarding money and articles of enjoyment out of selfish aim will avail you no good. Do not keep more than what suffices your needs. If you do you are committing a great social evil. By the practice of this virtue you can have clear knowledge of past and future births.\n\nYou must also practise the following Niyamas (external disciplines) in right earnest:—\n\n∆ Purity (Śaucaṁ) ∆ — Dress and food must be clean and pious. Internal purity is to have healthy and pious thoughts and friendliness towards all. Attachment and hatred are both impurities. Throw them off into the river so that they do not come to you again. By doing so you will understand that this body is always impure. Renunciation will dawn. \n\n∆ Contentment (Santōṣaṁ) ∆ — Have faith in yourself and never be greedy. You will get immense joy. You must be always up and doing but do not feed greed.\n\n∆ Penance (Tapas) ∆ — Follow your duty according to your own capacity and circumstances, even if you may have to face hardship. Your internal organs will get purified by doing so. You will develop fine intellect to enable you to understand the subtleties of life.\n\n∆ Self-study (Svadhyāya) ∆ — Study of the sacred scriptures of Trīka śāsana leading to knowledge of Self. Repetition of Gāyatrī Mantra with Aum syllable and breathing exercise (Prāṇāyāma) will lead you to study your own self. By this you can receive the favour of your ideal deity.\n\n∆ Surrender to Self (Īśvarapraṇidhānaṁ) ∆ — Always resign yourself to the will of Self. That will ward off all obstacles and grant success in concentration.\n\nIn summing up, I have to say again that unless you are friendly among yourselves, unless you cultivate the habit of being truthful, unless you give up looking to the faults of others, unless you eradicate greed and unless you cast your life according to the injunctions of the Sacred Ordinance, mere studying and learning lessons will avail nothing. Your thoughts must be pure and pious, you must be able to avoid greed with full confidence and faith in your own actions—Both past and present, you must increase your power of tolerance and endurance and you must witness your own deeds resigning everything to the will of Self. Then life will be beautiful and you will be blessed. To be continued on internal posture.\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\nSource:\n— The Awareness Of The Supreme Consciousness;\n— Revealed by Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"Practices/internal-posture":{"title":"internal posture","links":[],"tags":["discipline","practices","mind","purity","awareness","yama","niyama","asana","shuddhachitt","sadhana","articles"],"content":"Now I shall speak to you about the conquest of Internal Posture.\n\nThis is to get established at the junction—the middle or the meeting point of the two breaths. This is called the Pause.\nमध्यमं प्राणमाश्रित्य प्राणापानपथान्तरम् ।\nआलम्ब्य ज्ञानशक्तिं च तत्स्थं चैवासनं लभेत् ॥\n—Netra Tantra VI.1ff.\nMeaning:\nResting in the middle path at the junction–point of the inhaling and exhaling breaths with full awareness, constitutes the seat asana—of the yogi.\n\n“मध्यमं प्राणमाश्रित्य” (Madhyamaṁ praṇamāśritya) — Means that you should be aware at the juncture. You must be able to sit or pause at the middle path—the point where the two breaths meet; i.e. the point where the out-going breath exhausts and the in-coming breath takes strength. This is the junction of the middle point. You have to pause there. This is the centre of the two breaths. This is the important point which you can mark just after the stoppage of the out-going breath and just before the start of the in-coming breath and vice-versa. This point is at the end of the external measure of twelve units and at the end of the internal measure of twelve units of breath respectively. You have to concentrate with awareness at that point, which may be termed as centre also. Not only this. You have to concentrate at this centre even while you are taking your breath in or sending it out. Even while inhaling and exhaling you have to try to dwell at this centre with awareness. This is a super-conscious state, attainable through psychic energy.\n\nन दिवा पूजयेद्देवं रात्रौ नैव च नैव च ।\nअर्चयेद् देवदेवेशं दिनरात्रिपरिक्षये ॥\nMeaning:\nDo not worship the self-luminous Lord either at night or during the day. You must worship the Lord of lords at the junction of day and night.\nDay here means the out-going breath–prāṇa. Night means the in-coming breath–apāṇa. Parikṣaye does not mean “on being destroyed.” It means “at the junction, at the middle point of the two breaths” or you may call it the centre. So you must try to remain aware at the meeting point of the two breaths. I tell you firmly, if one can truly remain at the junction thus one is bound to succeed in one’s spiritual practice.\n\nWhen my master taught me spiritual practice, I did not follow first. Without following the instructions correctly I started the practice. Just as I ask Makhan Lal Mujoo to do a particular work, he stands up quickly and starts doing it without following the instructions well. I was just taking my breath in and out. Nothing happened, no experience. In this course I felt sleepy and in a dreaming condition also I was taking my breath in and out in the same way as I did while awake. In this condition also I felt that I was achieving nothing. I thought, during the course of the dream, that it was mere waste of time. I went to the Ashrama. There I saw my grand master sitting in his usual pose. I related my difficulty to him. I told him that my master had instructed me to do spiritual practice in such and such way and that on doing so nothing had happened. He, in reply, told me that I should remain at the junction. Just then I woke up.\n\nLater I related this whole dream and the preceding disappointment to my master. He said, “You make haste, without following the instructions well you got up and took to spiritual practice. You must follow the instructions perfectly well first and then sit for the practice. Taking to spiritual practice with awareness is not an easy job. You have to be aware there at the door of brahmapuri. You have to remain waiting and watching at the middle point, called sandhi or sandh.”\n\nSo you will succeed in spiritual practice only when you can remain aware at the junction, at the middle point. This is called madhya dhāma. I just told you: “na divā pūjayet devaṁ, rātrau naiva ca naiva ca.”\nयुञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानसः ।\nशान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति ॥\n—Gītā VI.15.\nMeaning:\nThus the yogi who with his well governed mind, constantly dwells on Self, attains lasting peace that consists of supreme bliss.\n\nYou must not do the spiritual practice in a routine way. You have to do it with eagerness. You must be earnest about it. You must sit for spiritual practice after liberating yourself from all kinds of distraction.\n“Madbhaktaḥ” means one who is attached to spiritual practice. One who is very earnest about it.\nYou must be able to find and feel joy in spiritual practice. It must not be like a burden to you, or you must not feel it like that.\n“Śantiṁ” means that you must attain to the peace of the true self. You must feel peaceful. What kind of peace?\n“Nirvāṇa paramāṁ” this means that peace which will lead you towards mokṣa or liberation. That is it.\n“Matsaṁsthāṁ” means that peace should be in my kingdom. It should be in my true Self.\n\nSo you must first try to undo all the intricate knots of your mind. This is very important. You must try your utmost at this otherwise it is all waste. All time and all efforts get wasted. You cannot get any fruit of your efforts without awareness. You must attend to this point first.\nYou must follow your preceptor, your guide. Do not look for help from your fellow traveller. To get rid of all kinds of obstacles you must follow the instructions of your Guru alone. You must wait for his word and you must watch his hissing sound. That is the clear way for the purification of mind.\nThat will do for today.\nRest on the next Sunday.\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\nSource:\n— The Awareness Of The Supreme Consciousness;\n— Revealed by Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"Practices/purity-of-mind":{"title":"purity of mind","links":[],"tags":["discipline","practices","mind","purity","awareness","yama","niyama","asana","shuddhachitt","sadhana","articles"],"content":"—Śuddhacitt &amp; Āsana—\n—Swami Lakshamanjoo—\n∫Sunday, May 4, 1980∫\n\nPurity of mind is the first requisite for spiritual practice. If the mind is free from attachment and detachment, love and hatred, praise and blame, it can remain stable; and then it is termed a clean mind. You must be able to cultivate equality in spirit. Then only will spiritual practice become successful. Otherwise all goes vain and nothing is achieved. The first and foremost condition for spiritual practice is the adoption of a steady posture.\n\nWhichever recognized pose you adopt for yourself or is advised by your master, you must stick to it and you must be able to remain in it for long at least two hours and without the slightest movement or distraction. There should be no cause for making any movement. You should not yawn, nor look sideways, you should not stretch your muscles. There should be no bending position. You must be able to sit straight with your spinal column erect. You must sit like a rock. Then by mere sitting thus and even without doing any spiritual practice, your mind will become steady, serene and purified. This is called the “conquest of posture” — āsanajaya. By this the spiritual practice easily gains strength. You can see this for yourselves. Even one hour’s sitting without any movement, will give your mind steadiness. You will feel peace.\n\nThen you will feel no necessity of practising the conquest of mind according to this sloka of the Bhagavad Gitā:—\nयतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।\nततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव शमं नयेत् ॥\n— Gītā VI.26\nMeaning:\nRestraining the restless and unsteady mind from all those objects after which it runs, one should concentrate it on Self.\n\nThere is no need of following this practice. By conquering the posture the mind automatically becomes stable. This is stated in the Gitā:—\nसमं कायशिरोग्रीवं धारयन्नचलं स्थिरः ।\nसम्प्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन् ॥\nप्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः ।\nमनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः ॥\n—Gītā VI.13-14.\nMeaning:\nWith body, head and neck upright and steady, eyes turned to the point of the nose and gaze not wandering; maintaining internal calm, fearless, determined on the vow of brahmacaryaṁ and with the mind well governed, he should sit harmoniously absorbed in Self. \n“समं कायशिरोग्रीवं” (Samaṁ kāyaśirōgrīvaṁ) — That means that body, mind, neck and head should remain straight during the whole time of spiritual practice. That is the true posture. That should be acalaṁ—without any movement, and then the practiser&#039;s mind should be sthīraḥ—one-pointed, fixed on one object. All the formalities and preliminary duties should have been fulfilled, even the obligations pertaining to bodily needs. There should be no kind of distraction, i.e. clothes must have been washed and vegetables etc. purchased.\nThen sit in your posture for spiritual practice.\nWhere? Which is the place for that?\n“संपश्यन्नासिकाग्रं स्वं” (Saṁpaśyaṇnāsikāgraṁ svaṁ) — At the end of the twelve unit measure of your breath i.e. at dvādaśānta. You must seat yourself at the point of concentration as taught to you by your master. Exactly with the same zeal and in the same way as at the beginning should you mentally sit at the point of concentration.\n\nWhat else is to follow?\n“दिशचानवलोकयन्” (Diśaścanavalokayaṇ) — You should carry no load of unnecessary thinking with you, no worry, and no care.\n\n“प्रशान्तात्मा” (Praśaṇtātmā) — You must not have to think: “I shall be late for office, I have to see such and such a person, I have to attend this business or that. Now I should run through my practice and leave early.” No, forget all this first and then take to spiritual practice.\n\n“विगतभीः” (Vigatabhīḥ) — You should not have this fear in mind that you have left that piece of work half-done and that you will have to face a loss. In this context you may think, “this is a more important piece of work to attend, this is duty. So I shall leave this spiritual practice half-way or I shall resume it later.” This must not be done.\n\n“ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः” (Brahmacārivratē sthitaḥ) — You must remain in continued concentration on the real nature of Parabhairava, which is Supreme Consciousness. That is the vow of brahmacaryaṁ. A brahmacārī is not only one who has a big tilaka (a colour sign besmeared) on his forehead or who only attends to his long matted hair hanging from the top of his head, or who displays a big rosary round his neck or any other sign of the sort. Maintaining Supreme Consciousness alone, constant and continued, is brahmacarya.\n\nSo far I have talked to you about the conquest of posture—āsanajaya in the process of purifying the mind.\n∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞\nSource:\n— The Awareness Of The Supreme Consciousness;\n— Revealed by Īśvarasvarupa Swāmī Lakṣamaṇajū."},"Trikashasan/trikashasana-viewpoint/The-Aparātāntrik-Analysis-Of-Vedā-s-–-EN":{"title":"■ The Aparātāntrik Analysis Of Vedā-s – Trikaśāsana Viewpoint. ■","links":[],"tags":["trikashasan","viewpoint","articles","kashmirshaivism","vedas","paratantras","paraparatantras","aparatantras","comparativestudies","history"],"content":"Bhārat is a country of unity in diversity. From ancient times, various streams of knowledge and science have been flooding here. Vedā-s, Upaniṣads, Purānā-s, Vedānga-s and Ādhibhautik spiritual sciences have been flowing here in the tradition of study and teaching in their entirety. Philosophy is a great channel of this flow. The only aim of all knowledge and science is – happiness in worldly life. The path described by other scriptures provides temporary and incomplete happiness, but philosophy is the only highway that is capable of providing exclusive and ultimate happiness in life. In that too, Western philosophy talks only about principles. Its practical aspect is zero.\n\nThere are two main streams of Bhāratiya philosophy – Naigmik and Āgamik. Both these streams flow the Gangā and Yamunā of principles and sādhanā together. Vedā-s are at the base of Naigamik or Vedic Sādhanā and Tantra is at the base of Āgamik or Tāntrik Sādhanā. In their initial period, both these Sādhanā-s were flowing in their pure form on their respective paths but in the later period, there was a mixture or syncretism between these two traditions. Not only this, there was a mixture between the Smārtha and Purānik streams based on Vedik Sādhanā. Just as the secondary streams emerged and developed in the course of development of Vedik Sādhanā, in the same way, various streams emerged and syncretized in the course of Tāntrik Sādhanā also.\n\nThe result of this syncretism was that both Vedik and Tāntrik streams complemented each other and the scholars of Tantra Śāstra had to declare –\n“गर्भाधानादितः कृत्वा यावदुवाहमेव च।”\ngarbhādhānāditaḥ kṛtvā yāvaduvāhamevaca|\nAnd,\n“तावत्तु वैदिकं कर्म पश्चाच्छेवे हानन्यभाक्॥”\ntāvattu vaidikaṃ karma paścācċheve hānanyabhāk||\nतत्रास्य गर्भाधानं च युक्तं पुंसवनादिभिः।\nगर्भनिष्क्रामपर्यन्तैरेकां कुर्वीत संस्क्रियाम्॥\n—तं. आ. १७.३६\ntatrāsya garbhādhānaṃ ċa yuktaṃ puṇsavanādibhiḥ|\ngarbhaniṣkrāmaparyaṇtairekāṃ kurvīt saṇkriyām||\ntạṃ. ā. 17. 36\nVeda and Tantra, despite being verbal, are actually two types of the same knowledge. This knowledge is divine and indestructible. Whatever meaning may be derived from the word Veda from an external point of view, in reality and in essence the form or meaning of the Veda is specific to extrasensory verbal subtle knowledge.\n\nThe mantra-seeing sages, after attaining this, became omniscient and ultimately achieved self-realization and made their lives successful. That is why it is written in Purākalp –\n“यां सूक्ष्मां नित्यामतीन्द्रियां वाचं ऋषयः साक्षात्कृतधर्माणो मन्त्रदृशः पश्यन्ति तां असाक्षात्कृतधर्मेभ्यः परेभ्यः प्रतिवेदयिष्यमाणा बिल्वं समामनन्ति स्वप्ने वृत्तमिव दृष्टश्रुतानुभूतमाचिख्यासन्ते।”\n“yāṃ sukṣmāṃ nityāmatīṇdriyāṇ vācaṃ ṛṣayaḥ sākṣātkṛtdharmāno mantradṛśaḥ paśyanti tāṃ asākṣātkṛtdharmebhyaḥ parebhyaḥ prativedayiśyamānā bilvaṃ samāmanaṇtī swapne vṛttmiva dṛṣtaśrutanubhūtamāchikhyāsante.”\nThose sages who have realized the principle of Dharma, can daily see the subtle voice beyond the senses. Those who have not realized the principle of Dharma cannot see it. To make such people aware of the subtle speech, the sages reveal that extrasensory speech in the form of sensual Vedā-s. This Veda Vedānga-s itself is the text of the word “Bilva”. Just as gross sensory speech is used to express dream experiences, similarly, to express extra-sensory subtle speech, the use of gross speech becomes necessary. Parāvāk is subtle speech. Vedā-s are the incarnate forms of this Parāvāk, not its form because it is not possible for Parāvāk to appear before ordinary humans, except for the sages who have seen mantra-s. Veda is actually one and basically inseparable. It is not verbal but cognitive. At the time of expression, it becomes verbal and manifests in the form of word sequence.\n\nVeda is the means of attaining Śiva. Śiva attainment is achieved by breaking the knot of “Ahaṃ”. The knot of “Ahaṃ” manifests in the form of “Ahaṃ” and “Maṃ”. The prevalent Vedā-s are unmanifested in many forms. These are just imitations of that unmanifested undivided Veda. Yogi Bhartṛhari has also called the Vedā-s as imitations –\nप्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः।\nएकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक्॥\n—वा. प. १.५\nprāptyupāyoऽnukāraśca tasya vedo maharṣibhiḥ\nekoऽpyanekavartmeva samāṃnātaḥ pṛṯakpṛṭak\n—vā. pa. 1.5\n\nVedā-s are the only Aparātantra which are cognitive and verbal. Samvetā Śakti in Śiva has three forms: Īcchā ; Jñāna ; and Krīyā . The power in the form of will is beyond and indistinct. Jñānarupīnī Śakti is of two types, on the basis of upper and upper discrimination. Parāparājñāna is cognitive and aparājñāna is verbal. This verbal knowledge is established in the form of scriptures. Perceptive aparājñāna (verbal aparājñāna) i.e. based on words, interpretation is done in the Vedā-s. In the new period of world creation, Lord Śiva publishes knowledge in the Vedā-s for the purpose of attaining supreme liberation. This same knowledge, when in verbal form, is called Aparātantra. In this way, Vedā-s are proved to be other Aparātantra-s.\n—  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です."},"Trikashasan/trikashasana-viewpoint/The-Aparātāntrik-Analysis-Of-Vedā-s":{"title":"■ वेदोंका अपरतंत्रीक विश्लेषण — त्रिक शासन दृष्टिकोन. ■","links":[],"tags":["trikashasan","viewpoint","articles","kashmirshaivism","vedas","paratantras","paraparatantras","aparatantras","comparativestudies","history"],"content":"भारतवर्ष अनेकता में एकता का देश है। अति प्राचीन काल से ही विभिन्न ज्ञानविज्ञान की धारायें भारतभूमि को आप्यायित करती आ रही हैं। वेद, उपनिषद्, पुराण, वेदाङ्ग एवं आधिभौतिक आध्यात्मिक शास्त्र यहाँ अपनी पूर्णता के साथ अध्ययन-अध्यापन की परम्परा में प्रवाहित होते रहे हैं। दर्शनशास्त्र इसी प्रवाह की एक महनीय कुल्या है। समस्त ज्ञानविज्ञान का एकमात्र लक्ष्य है—सांसारिक जीवन मे आंनद। अन्यान्य शास्त्र जिस प्रकार के मार्ग का वर्णन करते हैं वह अस्थायी एवं अपूर्ण आंनद प्रदान करता है परंतु दर्शन शास्त्र ही एक ऐसा राजमार्ग है जो जीवन मे ऐकान्तिक एवं आत्यन्तिक आनन्द दिलाने में समर्थ है। उसमें भी पाश्चात्त्य दर्शन केवल सिद्धान्त की बात करता है। उसका व्यावहारिक पक्ष शून्य है।\n\nभारतीय दर्शन की दो प्रमुख धारायें हैं— नैगमिक और आगमिक। ये दोनों धारायें सिद्धान्त एवं साधना की गङ्गा यमुना को एक साथ प्रवाहित करती हैं। नैगमिक अथवा वैदिक साधना के मूल में वेद और आगमिक या तान्त्रिक साधना के मूल में तन्त्र हैं। अपने प्रारम्भिक काल में ये दोनों साधनायें अपने-अपने मार्गों पर शुद्ध रूप से प्रवाहित हो रही थीं किन्तु परवर्ती काल में इन दोनों परम्पराओं में परस्पर मिश्रण अथवा साङ्कर्य हो गया। इतना ही नहीं वैदिक साधनामूलक स्मार्त्त एवं पौराणिक धाराओं में भी मिश्रण हुआ। जिस प्रकार वैदिक साधना के विकासक्रम में अवान्तर धाराओं का उद्भव और विकास हुआ उसी प्रकार तान्त्रिक साधना के क्रम में भी विभिन्न धाराओं का आविर्भाव और साङ्कर्य हुआ।\n\nइस साङ्कर्य का परिणाम यह हुआ कि वैदिक एवं तान्त्रिक दोनों धारायें एक दूसरे की पूरक हो गयीं और तन्त्रशास्त्र के विद्वानों को यह उद्घोष करना पड़ा—\n“गर्भाधानादितः कृत्वा यावदुवाहमेव च।”\nतथा,\n“तावत्तु वैदिकं कर्म पश्चाच्छेवे हानन्यभाक्॥”\nतत्रास्य गर्भाधानं च युक्तं पुंसवनादिभिः।\nगर्भनिष्क्रामपर्यन्तैरेकां कुर्वीत संस्क्रियाम्॥\n—तं. आ. १७.३६\nवेद एवं तन्त्र शब्दात्मक होने पर भी वस्तुतः एक ही ज्ञान के दो प्रकार हैं। ये ज्ञान दिव्य एवं अपौरुषेय है। बहिर्मुखी दृष्टि से वेद शब्द का चाहे जो अर्थ निकाला जाय वस्तुतः एवं तत्त्वतः वेद का स्वरूप अथवा अर्थ अतीन्द्रिय शब्दात्मक सूक्ष्म ज्ञानविशेष है।\n\nमन्त्रद्रष्टा ऋषिगण इसे प्राप्त कर सर्वज्ञ होते थे और अन्त में आत्म-साक्षात्कार कर अपना जीवन सफल बनाते थे। इसीलिये पुराकल्प में लिखा है—\n“यां सूक्ष्मां नित्यामतीन्द्रियां वाचं ऋषयः साक्षात्कृतधर्माणो मन्त्रदृशः पश्यन्ति तां असाक्षात्कृतधर्मेभ्यः परेभ्यः प्रतिवेदयिष्यमाणा बिल्वं समामनन्ति स्वप्ने वृत्तमिव दृष्टश्रुतानुभूतमाचिख्यासन्ते।”\nजिन्होंने धर्मतत्त्व का साक्षात्कार कर लिया है वे ऋषिगण नित्य इन्द्रियातीत सूक्ष्मावाक् का दर्शन करते हैं। जिन्हें धर्मतत्त्व का साक्षात्कार नहीं हुआ है वे उसका दर्शन नहीं कर सकते। ऐसे लोगों को सूक्ष्मावाक् का संवेदन कराने के लिये ऋषिगण उस अतीन्द्रिय वाणी को इन्द्रियगम्य वेद वेदाङ्ग के रूप में प्रकट करते हैं। यह वेद वेदाङ्ग ही “बिल्व” पद का वाच्य है। स्वप्नानुभूति को प्रकट करने के लिये जैसे स्थूल इन्द्रिय वाणी का प्रयोग किया जाता है उसी प्रकार अतीन्द्रिय सूक्ष्मावाक् का भी निरूपण करने के लिये स्थूलवाणी का आश्रयण आवश्यक हो जाता है। परावाक् ही सूक्ष्मावाक् है। वेद इसी परावाक् के अवतीर्ण रूप हैं स्वरूप नहीं क्योंकि मन्त्रदृष्टा ऋषियों को छोड़कर साधारण मनुष्य के समक्ष परावाक् प्रकट हो, यह सम्भव नहीं। वेद वस्तुतः एक और मूलतः अभिन्न है। यह वागात्मक नहीं बोधात्मक है। अभिव्यक्ति काल में यह वागात्मक होकर शब्द-क्रम से प्रकाशित होता है।\n\nवेद शिवप्राप्ति का उपाय है। शिवप्राप्ति “अहम्” ग्रन्थि के कर्त्तन से होती है। “अहम्” ग्रन्थि “अहम्” और “मम्” के रूप में प्रकाशित होती है। प्रचलित वेद अनेक रूपों में आम्नात हैं। ये उस अनाम्नात अखण्ड वेद के अनुकार मात्र है। योगी भर्तृहरि ने भी वेदों को अनुकार ही कहा है—\nप्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः।\nएकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक्॥\n—वा. प. १.५\n\nवेद ही अपरतन्त्र है जो बोधात्मक एवं वागात्मक हैं। शिव में समवेता शक्ति के तीन रूप हैं ईच्छा; ज्ञान; और क्रिया। ईच्छारूपिणी शक्ति परा और अभेद है। ज्ञानरूपिणी शक्ति पर और अपर भेद से दो प्रकार की हैं। परापरज्ञान बोधात्मक और अपरज्ञान वागात्मक है। यह वागात्मक ज्ञान शास्त्ररूप में प्रतिष्ठित है। बोधात्मक परापरज्ञान वागात्मक अपरज्ञान अर्थात् शब्द पर आरूढ़ होकर अर्थप्रकाशन वेदों में प्रवृत्त होता है। विश्वसृष्टि के उन्मेषकाल में भगवान् परम शिव परापर मुक्ति के सम्पादन के लिये ज्ञान को वेदोंमे प्रकाशित करते हैं। यही ज्ञान वागात्मक होने पर अपरतंत्र नाम से अभिहित होता है। इस प्रकार वेद अपर तंत्र सिद्ध होते है।\n— नागकुमार です."},"about-us":{"title":"who are we?","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"hail, noble seeker, and welcome to the sacred domain of karpurgauram!
