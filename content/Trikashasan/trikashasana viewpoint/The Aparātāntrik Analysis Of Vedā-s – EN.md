#### Bhārat is a country of unity in diversity. From ancient times, various streams of knowledge and science have been flooding here. Vedā-s, Upaniṣads, Purānā-s, Vedānga-s and Ādhibhautik spiritual sciences have been flowing here in the tradition of study and teaching in their entirety. Philosophy is a great channel of this flow. The only aim of all knowledge and science is – happiness in worldly life. The path described by other scriptures provides temporary and incomplete happiness, but philosophy is the only highway that is capable of providing exclusive and ultimate happiness in life. In that too, Western philosophy talks only about principles. Its practical aspect is zero.

#### There are two main streams of Bhāratiya philosophy – Naigmik and Āgamik. Both these streams flow the Gangā and Yamunā of principles and sādhanā together. Vedā-s are at the base of Naigamik or Vedic Sādhanā and Tantra is at the base of Āgamik or Tāntrik Sādhanā. In their initial period, both these Sādhanā-s were flowing in their pure form on their respective paths but in the later period, there was a mixture or syncretism between these two traditions. Not only this, there was a mixture between the Smārtha and Purānik streams based on Vedik Sādhanā. Just as the secondary streams emerged and developed in the course of development of Vedik Sādhanā, in the same way, various streams emerged and syncretized in the course of Tāntrik Sādhanā also.

**The result of this syncretism was that both Vedik and Tāntrik streams complemented each other and the scholars of Tantra Śāstra had to declare –**

`“गर्भाधानादितः कृत्वा यावदुवाहमेव च।”`
`garbhādhānāditaḥ kṛtvā yāvaduvāhamevaca|`

And,

`“तावत्तु वैदिकं कर्म पश्चाच्छेवे हानन्यभाक्॥”` 
`tāvattu vaidikaṃ karma paścācċheve hānanyabhāk||`

`तत्रास्य गर्भाधानं च युक्तं पुंसवनादिभिः।` 
`गर्भनिष्क्रामपर्यन्तैरेकां कुर्वीत संस्क्रियाम्॥` 
`—तं. आ. १७.३६`
`tatrāsya garbhādhānaṃ ċa yuktaṃ puṇsavanādibhiḥ|`
`garbhaniṣkrāmaparyaṇtairekāṃ kurvīt saṇkriyām||`
`tạṃ. ā. 17. 36`

#### Veda and Tantra, despite being verbal, are actually two types of the same knowledge. This knowledge is divine and indestructible. Whatever meaning may be derived from the word Veda from an external point of view, in reality and in essence the form or meaning of the Veda is specific to extrasensory verbal subtle knowledge.

**The mantra-seeing sages, after attaining this, became omniscient and ultimately achieved self-realization and made their lives successful. That is why it is written in Purākalp –**

`“यां सूक्ष्मां नित्यामतीन्द्रियां वाचं ऋषयः साक्षात्कृतधर्माणो मन्त्रदृशः पश्यन्ति तां असाक्षात्कृतधर्मेभ्यः परेभ्यः प्रतिवेदयिष्यमाणा बिल्वं समामनन्ति स्वप्ने वृत्तमिव दृष्टश्रुतानुभूतमाचिख्यासन्ते।”` 
`“yāṃ sukṣmāṃ nityāmatīṇdriyāṇ vācaṃ ṛṣayaḥ sākṣātkṛtdharmāno mantradṛśaḥ paśyanti tāṃ asākṣātkṛtdharmebhyaḥ parebhyaḥ prativedayiśyamānā bilvaṃ samāmanaṇtī swapne vṛttmiva dṛṣtaśrutanubhūtamāchikhyāsante.”` 
 
#### Those sages who have realized the principle of Dharma, can daily see the subtle voice beyond the senses. Those who have not realized the principle of Dharma cannot see it. To make such people aware of the subtle speech, the sages reveal that extrasensory speech in the form of sensual Vedā-s. This Veda Vedānga-s itself is the text of the word “Bilva”. Just as gross sensory speech is used to express dream experiences, similarly, to express extra-sensory subtle speech, the use of gross speech becomes necessary. Parāvāk is subtle speech. Vedā-s are the incarnate forms of this Parāvāk, not its form because it is not possible for Parāvāk to appear before ordinary humans, except for the sages who have seen mantra-s. Veda is actually one and basically inseparable. It is not verbal but cognitive. At the time of expression, it becomes verbal and manifests in the form of word sequence.

#### Veda is the means of attaining Śiva. Śiva attainment is achieved by breaking the knot of “Ahaṃ”. The knot of “Ahaṃ” manifests in the form of “Ahaṃ” and “Maṃ”. The prevalent Vedā-s are unmanifested in many forms. These are just imitations of that unmanifested undivided Veda. Yogi Bhartṛhari has also called the Vedā-s as imitations –

`प्राप्त्युपायोऽनुकारश्च तस्य वेदो महर्षिभिः।` 
`एकोऽप्यनेकवर्त्मेव समाम्नातः पृथक्पृथक्॥`
`—वा. प. १.५`
`prāptyupāyoऽnukāraśca tasya vedo maharṣibhiḥ`
`ekoऽpyanekavartmeva samāṃnātaḥ pṛṯakpṛṭak`
`—vā. pa. 1.5`
![Pasted image 20250109151441.png](../../metadata/images/Pasted%20image%2020250109151441.png)
#### Vedā-s are the only Aparātantra which are cognitive and verbal. Samvetā Śakti in Śiva has three forms: Īcchā <Will>; Jñāna <Knowledge>; and Krīyā <Action>. The power in the form of will is beyond and indistinct. Jñānarupīnī Śakti is of two types, on the basis of upper and upper discrimination. Parāparājñāna is cognitive and aparājñāna is verbal. This verbal knowledge is established in the form of scriptures. Perceptive aparājñāna (verbal aparājñāna) i.e. based on words, interpretation is done in the Vedā-s. In the new period of world creation, Lord Śiva publishes knowledge in the Vedā-s for the purpose of attaining supreme liberation. This same knowledge, when in verbal form, is called Aparātantra. In this way, Vedā-s are proved to be other Aparātantra-s.
