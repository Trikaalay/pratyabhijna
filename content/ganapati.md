असूरसूरवृन्दवन्दितमभिमतवरवितरणे निरतम्।
    दर्शनशताग्र्यपूज्यं प्राणतनुं गणपतिं वन्दे॥

my first adoration to the lotus-feets of GAṆAPATI; the master of śiva's servants; who is the representation of breath-outgoing and dedicated to fulfillment of the most highest wishes and worshipped by the assembly of devā-s and asurā-s; also the most and first among all the darśana-s to be worshipped above anybody.

— mahāmaheśvara abhinavaguptaḥ.
