`•~• Welcome Note •~•`

A secret layer of Non-dual Trīka Śaivadharma, heavily rooted and influenced by Non-dual Bhairava Āgama-s, Aesthetics and the Pratyabhijñā, Spanda, Krama and Kula together known as Trika philosophy of Gurudeva Mahāmaheśvara Abhinavagupta.

We embrace all genres of dark and light introspective Tāntrik insights and wisdom.

This place is best described as Esoteric Revival mixed with deep introspective of the hidden secrets of the Non-dual Bhairava Āgamas and their esoteric teachings.

> Understanding this Trīka philosophy and choice are what defines one's own Self.
> Esoteric Trīka Mārga/path encourages **Self discovery** above all else.

We are deeply devoted to Trika philosophical insights with common interests often including:
